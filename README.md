# Mod-5-Matplotlib
Module 5 plotting charts &amp; graphs with code

This readme will direct you within this repository

In this repository we have data from lab trials on mice
The core data is on two csv files in the pymaceuticals and data folder
Also within the pymaceuticals is our two code sheets
pymaceuticals_primary.ipynb is our primary code with all of my work on it
pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb is an example code uneditied for reference

Within the main code the two csv files our brought in via a relative path that is designed to work once this repo is cloned to your pc
Once this repo is on your pc you can open the file in jupyter lab 
In jupyter lab we can see the two csv's into dataframes and a merged together data frame

This data is broken down into different summary tables, graphs, and charts 
As you will see both the original dataframes and the combined data frame is used to get the requested results
